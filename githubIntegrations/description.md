###Tagline
Merge with confidence.

###Short description
ReviewNinja is a code review tool for GitHub that lets you merge pull requests with confidence.

###Description
ReviewNinja is a light-weight code-review tool which fits neatly into the GitHub pull request workflow. It presents all the project information needed to commit a pull request and merge code confidently.

### Why ReviewNinja

We created ReviewNinja because quality code reviews are how you get quality code.

As important as they are, code reviews should never stop your project cold. They should be part of your work, but stealthy... like a ninja!

With ease and minimal work interruption, ReviewNinja tracks repository changes, and supports structured code reviews with comments and issues right down to the line of code.
