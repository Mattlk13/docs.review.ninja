What is ReviewNinja?
---------------------

ReviewNinja is a lightweight tool deeply integrated with GitHub that helps you perform code reviews quickly and efficiently. ReviewNinja supports hassle-free committing and merging through pull requests, with a simple voting system. Our primary focus is to make it easier to identify, review, and collaborate in code reviews.

ReviewNinja stores the least amount of information from your GitHub account to make the app work. It ensures that the necessary data is up to date and the data is stored at GitHub only.  None of your code is stored with ReviewNinja.  

ReviewNinja integrates into GitHub.com as well as GitHub Enterprise. The application stack includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB and AngularJS.

Why should I use ReviewNinja?
------------------------------

ReviewNinja defines a clear process for code review in GitHub. It also provides a status overview so that team members in other departments, such as product management or design, can quickly grasp the state of the project.
